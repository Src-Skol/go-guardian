This code appears to define an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that is passed an anonymous function as an argument. The anonymous function takes a single parameter, e.

Inside the function, an empty object named t is defined. Then, a function named i is defined. i takes a single parameter, n.

The function i has several conditional statements and function calls inside it. It appears to be a module loader of some sort, possibly for loading JavaScript modules.

There are multiple entries in the module, each with a numerical index. The code at each of these indices defines a function or an object.

It is not clear what the purpose of this code is without more context.
